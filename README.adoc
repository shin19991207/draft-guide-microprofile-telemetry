Before you begin, ensure that Docker is installed and running on your system. For installation instructions, see the https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^].

The https://github.com/grafana/docker-otel-lgtm/?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-otel-lgtm[Grafana OTel LGTM Stack^] is an all-in-one Docker image containing an OpenTelemetry Collector that receives and forwards telemetry data to Tempo for traces, Prometheus for metrics, and Loki for logs. The collected data can be visualized by Grafana.

You will use Docker to start the Grafana OTel LGTM stack, which serves as the OpenTelemetry-compatible backend for collecting and visualizing telemetry data.

Start the Grafana OTel LGTM stack by running the following Docker command:

[role="command"]
----
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 --rm -ti grafana/otel-lgtm
----

Once the container is up and running, you can access the Grafana dashboard at the http://localhost:3000 URL.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to build the `system` service and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl system liberty:run
----

Next, open another command-line session in the `finish` directory and run the following command to start the `inventory` service:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl inventory liberty:run
----

After you see the following message in both command-line sessions, both of your services are ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Once both services are running, visit the following endpoints:

* The http://localhost:9080/system/properties URL returns system properties from the `system` service.

* The http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems URL displays the current contents of the inventory.

* The http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL adds your local system properties to the inventory.

To explore the telemetry data, open the Grafana dashboard at the http://localhost:3000 URL and follow these steps:

**View traces with Tempo:**

1. Open the **Explore** view from the left-hand menu.

2. Select **Tempo** as the data source.

3. Set **Query type** to `Search`.

4. Click **Run query** to list recent traces.

5. Click a trace ID to inspect the spans and details from the `inventory` or `system` services.

image::inventory_service_spans.png[Get /localhost traces for the inventory service,align="center"]

**View metrics with Prometheus:**

1. Open the **Drilldown -> Metrics** view from the left-hand menu. This view shows a query-less experience for browsing the available metrics collected by Prometheus.

2. For a more detailed view of any metric, click the **Select** button next to its graph.

image::metrics_overview.png[Metrics overview,align="center"]

**View logs with Loki:**

1. Open the **Drilldown -> Logs** view from the left-hand menu. This view displays an overview of time series and log visualizations for all services sending logs to Loki.

2. Click the **Show logs** button for a specific service to display its logs.

3. Expand a log entry to view the full message along with its trace context.

image::log_detail_example.png[Example of log detail,align="center"]

After you're finished reviewing the application, stop the Open Liberty instances by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran the `system` and `inventory` services. Alternatively, you can run the following goals from the `finish` directory in another command-line session:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl system liberty:stop
mvn -pl inventory liberty:stop

// =================================================================================================
// Enabling automatic telemetry collection
// =================================================================================================
== Enabling automatic telemetry collection

MicroProfile Telemetry can automatically collect telemetry data without requiring changes to your application code. To collect and export telemetry data, you need to enable the MicroProfile Telemetry feature and configure the required OpenTelemetry properties in your application.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

Start by adding the MicroProfile Telemetry feature to the `server.xml` file of each service.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server.xml` file of the inventory service.#
`inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

inventory/server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=thirdParty']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=mpTelemetry file=0]`mpTelemetry` feature enables MicroProfile Telemetry support in Open Liberty for the `inventory` service.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server.xml` file of the system service.#
`system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

system/server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

Similarly, add the [hotspot=mpTelemetry file=1]`mpTelemetry` feature to enable telemetry support in the `system` service.

By default, MicroProfile Telemetry is disabled to reduce performance overhead. To enable it, set the `otel.sdk.disabled` property to `false` in a valid configuration source.

[role="code_command hotspot file=2", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the bootstrap.properties file for the inventory service.#
`inventory/src/main/liberty/config/bootstrap.properties`
----

inventory/bootstrap.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/liberty/config/bootstrap.properties[]
----

Set the [hotspot=disabled file=2]`otel.sdk.disabled=false` property in the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/bootstrap-properties.html[bootstrap properties^] file to enable telemetry collection. Because this file applies configuration at the runtime level, it allows both runtime and application telemetry to be collected. If you instead configure this property at the application level, runtime telemetry will not be collected. See the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-telemetry.html#global[MicroProfile Telemetry configuration documentation^] for details.

The [hotspot=service file=2]`otel.service.name` property sets the service name to `inventory`, which helps identify the source of the telemetry data in monitoring tools like Grafana.

The Grafana OTel LGTM stack receives telemetry data via the OTLP protocol, which is the default for OpenTelemetry. Therefore, no additional exporter configuration is needed.

[role="code_command hotspot file=3", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the bootstrap.properties file for the system service.#
`system/src/main/liberty/config/bootstrap.properties`
----

system/bootstrap.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/liberty/config/bootstrap.properties[]
----

Similarly, configure the OpenTelemetry properties in the [hotspot file=3]`bootstrap.properties` file for the `system` service.

For more information about these and other Telemetry properties, see the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/microprofile-config-properties.html#telemetry[MicroProfile Config properties for MicroProfile Telemetry^] documentation.

// === Viewing the default telemetry data

Start the services to begin collecting telemetry data.

When you run Open Liberty in https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode^], dev mode listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following command to start the `system` service in dev mode:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl system liberty:dev
----

Open another command-line session and run the following command to start the `inventory` service in dev mode:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl inventory liberty:dev
----

After you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

Once both services are running, visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL to trigger the collection of automatic telemetry instrumentation. By default, OpenTelemetry generates trace spans for incoming HTTP requests to JAX-RS and REST endpoints, collects runtime and application metrics such as HTTP request durations and JVM performance, and captures message logs written by the application or Liberty runtime at the `INFO` level or higher.

To explore the automatic telemetry data, open the Grafana dashboard at the http://localhost:3000 URL.

View the traces that were automatically created from your request in the Grafana dashboard. From the left menu, open the **Explore** view and select **Tempo** as the data source. For **Query type**, choose `Search`, then click **Run query**. You will see that the first result is the trace for the `GET /inventory/systems/{hostname}` request from the `inventory` service. Click the trace ID to open the trace details and verify that there are two spans from the `inventory` service and one span from the `system` service.

image::inventory_default_spans.png[Inventory default spans,align="center"]

View the messages logs to see timestamped events from the server startup in the dashboard. Navigate to the **Drilldown -> Logs** from the menu. You can click on **Show logs** from each service to see the detailed context for each log.

image::logs_server_startup.png[Server startup logs,align="center"]

View an overview of the JVM metrics to get insights into class count, CPU usage, and heap memory utilization. Open the **Dashboards** view from menu and select the **JVM Overview (OpenTelemetry)** dashboard.

image::jvm_overview.png[JVM Overview,align="center"]

Open the **RED Metrics (classic histogram)** dashboard to get an overview of the HTTP request performance.

// =================================================================================================
== Enhancing application logs

When MicroProfile Telemetry is enabled, OpenTelemetry automatically collects logs from the Liberty message log stream. This includes logs written by the `java.util.logging` API at the `INFO` level or higher, as well as messages from the `System.out` standard output and `System.err` standard error streams. Liberty routes these standard streams into its unified logging framework, making them available for collection.

While `System.out` and `System.err` are useful for quick debugging, they are limited in production environments. These streams lack structure, consistent severity levels, and the contextual metadata that is critical for monitoring distributed systems. In contrast, the `java.util.logging` API produces structured logs with fine-grained control over log levels, built-in support for exceptions, and better integration with telemetry tools like Grafana.

SystemClient.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,doc']
----
include::start/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java[]
----

Currently, the [hotspot file=0]`SystemClient` class logs messages using [hotspot=out3 hotspot=out4 hotspot=out7 file=0]`System.out` and [hotspot=out1 hotspot=out2 hotspot=out5 hotspot=out6 file=0]`System.err`.

To observe a basic standard output log, point your browser to the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL and open the Grafana dashboard at the http://localhost:3000/ URL. In the **Explore** view, select the **Loki** data source and filter by `service_name = inventory`. Expand the log entry for `Received response with status: 200`. The message appears as an `info`-level log, and the `io_openliberty_module` field is set to `SystemOut`.

image::log_system_out_println_ok.png[Log by using the System.out.println method,align="center"]

Now access the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/unknown URL to simulate an exception. This request targets a non-existent host and triggers a `RuntimeException`. Re-run the same Grafana query. The resulting log appears with a `warn` level and the module set to `SystemErr`. The stack trace is embedded directly in the log body, making it harder to parse programmatically.

image::log_system_out_println_exception.png[Log by using the System.out.println method,align="center"]

Although both `System.out` and `System.err` logs are collected, you can see that they do not provide structured metadata. You cannot filter logs by severity beyond the basic `info` and `warn` levels, nor can you separate stack traces or correlate logs with the context effectively.

To enable structured logging, update your application to use the `java.util.logging` API.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,doc']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java[]
----

Update the [hotspot file=1]`SystemClient` class in the `inventory` service to use the [hotspot=getLogger file=1]`Logger.getLogger()` method to retrieve a logger instance, and the [hotspot=log1 hotspot=log2 hotspot=log3 hotspot=log4 hotspot=log5 hotspot=log6 hotspot=log7 file=1]`Logger.log()` method to emit log messages at specific levels like [hotspot=log3 hotspot=log7 file=1]`INFO`, [hotspot=log4 file=1]`WARNING`, or [hotspot=log1 hotspot=log2 hotspot=log5 hotspot=log6 file=1]`SEVERE` based on the context.

Because you are running the services in dev mode, the changes that you made are automatically picked up.

Return to the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL and re-run the Loki query in Grafana. This time, the log is more structured. The `io_openliberty_module` field contains the actual logger name, making it easier to trace log origins.

image::log_logger_ok.png[Log by using the java.util.logging API,align="center"]

Access the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/unknown URL again to generate an exception. The resulting log now includes the defined severity level (`error`), the structured `exception_stacktrace`, and the `exception_type` field such as `jakarta.ws.rs.ProcessingException`.

SystemResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java[]
----

Update the [hotspot file=2]`SystemResource` class in the `system` service to use the same logging approach. This ensures consistent logging across services. To view logs from both services together, open the **Drilldown -> Logs** view in Grafana. You can now analyze logs across distributed systems in a single interface.

By default, OpenTelemetry collects only message logs. For details on how to include additional sources, see https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-telemetry.html#logs[Collect logs from a specified source^].

== Enabling explicit metrics

In addition to the runtime metrics automatically collected with MicroProfile Telemetry, you can define custom metrics in your application by using the OpenTelemetry API.

To enable access to the OpenTelemetry API in your application, you must make third-party APIs visible by updating the `server.xml` configuration.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server.xml` file of the inventory service:#

----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The OpenTelemetry APIs are exposed as third-party APIs in Open Liberty. To make them accessible to your application, add the [hotspot=thirdParty file=0]`+third-party` value to the [hotspot=thirdParty file=0]`apiTypeVisibility` attribute of the [hotspot=thirdParty file=0]`classLoader` element in the `webApplication` configuration. This configuration adds `third-party` to the default list of API package types that are supported.

Once access to the OpenTelemetry API is configured, you can manually instrument your application to define custom metrics.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]

#Replace the InventoryManager class.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java`
----

InventoryManager.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::staging/InventoryManager.java[]
----

Inject the OpenTelemetry [hotspot=meter file=1]`Meter` interface into the [hotspot file=1]`InventoryManager` class to define and collect application-specific metrics. This interface provides access to the OpenTelemetry metrics API, which includes instruments such as counters, histograms, and gauges to monitor application behavior and performance.

Use the [hotspot=counterBuilder file=1]`Meter.counterBuilder()` method to define a counter instrument named [hotspot=inventoryListCount file=1]`inventory.list.count`. This metric tracks how many times the inventory list is requested. Every time the [hotspot=list file=1]`list()` method is called, the counter is incremented by one to reflect a new request to view the inventory.

Use the [hotspot=histogramBuilder file=1]`Meter.histogramBuilder()` method to define a histogram instrument named [hotspot=inventoryAddDuration file=1]`inventory.add.duration`. This metric measures the time it takes to add a system to the inventory. The [hotspot=addStart file=1]`start` time is recorded when the [hotspot=add file=1]`add()` method begins, and the [hotspot=addDuration file=1]`duration` is calculated and recorded when the method finishes.

Use the [hotspot=gaugeBuilder file=1]`Meter.gaugeBuilder()` method to define a gauge named [hotspot=inventorySize file=1]`inventory.size`, which records the number of systems currently in the inventory. The [hotspot=buildWithCallback file=1]`buildWithCallback()` method allows the value to be updated dynamically, ensuring that the metric always reflects the current size of the list.

Note that the metric names and attributes need to follow OpenTelemetry's https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/metrics/[general naming guidelines].

For a full list of available metrics, see https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/api/#meter[Meter operations^] in the OpenTelemetry documentation. For more information about OpenTelemetry metrics, see the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-api/latest/io/opentelemetry/api/metrics/package-summary.html[OpenTelemetry metrics API documentation^].

To view the custom metrics, first trigger activity in the application by visiting the following URLs in your browser:

* Visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL to add your local system properties to the inventory.

* Visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/127.0.0.1 URL to add the system properties for host `127.0.0.1` to the inventory.

* Visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems URL to display the current contents of the inventory. After the previous steps, the inventory should show two entries.

Next, open the Grafana dashboard at the http://localhost:3000 URL. From the left menu, navigate to **Drilldown -> Metrics**, then enter `inventory` in the **Search metrics** field to explore the metrics exposed by the service. You will see a result similar to the following:

image::inventory_custom_metrics.png[Inventory custom metrics,align="center"]

Note the difference between the metric name you define and the name you see in Grafana. For details on how OpenTelemetry metrics are transformed when exported to Prometheus, see the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/prometheus_and_openmetrics/#otlp-metric-points-to-prometheus[OTLP Metric points to Prometheus^] section of the OpenTelemetry specification.

Try accessing the endpoints multiple times and refreshing the Grafana dashboard to observe how the metrics update in real time.

MicroProfile Telemetry automatically instruments Jakarta RESTful Web Services and MicroProfile REST clients. To trace additional operations, such as internal logic or calls to external systems like database, you can add manual instrumentation to the source code.

Becuase you already make third-party APIs visible in the previous section in the inventory's [hotspot=thirdParty file=0]`server.xml` configuration, you have access to the OpenTelemetry API.

You can trace your Jakarta CDI beans by annotating a method with the `@WithSpan` annotation.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]

#Replace the `InventoryManager` class.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java`

include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java[]
----

The [hotspot=listMethod file=1]`list()` and [hotspot=addMethod file=1]`add()` methods are annotated with the [hotspot=addWithSpan hotspot=listWithSpan file=1]`@WithSpan` annotation. The [hotspot=listMethod file=1]`list()` method uses the default span name based on its method name, while the [hotspot=addMethod file=1]`add()` method specifies a custom span name, [hotspot=addWithSpan file=1]`Inventory Manager Add`. The instrumentation creates a new span for each annotated method call.

To enrich spans with additional context, you can annotate method parameters with the [hotspot=spanAttribute file=1]`@SpanAttribute` annotation. In this example, the `host` parameter in the [hotspot=addMethod file=1]`add()` method is labeled as [hotspot=spanAttribute file=1]`hostname` in the span.

To view the generated spans, visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems URL and open the Grafana dashboard at the http://localhost:3000 URL. In the **Explore** view, select the **Tempo** data source, select `Search` as **Query type**, filter by `Service Name = inventory`, and **Run query**. You'll see the result as:

image::inventory_manager_span.png[Inventory Manager span,align="center"]

Verify that there are two spans from the `inventory` service. Expand each span to view its details. You'll see the `InventoryManager.list` span that is created by the [hotspot=addWithSpan hotspot=listWithSpan file=1]`@WithSpan` annotation.

To check out the information generated by the `@SpanAttribute` annotation, visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL and then re-run your Grafana query. You will see the following result:

image::inventory_service_4_spans.png[Get traces for the inventory service,align="center"]

Verify that there are three spans from the `inventory` service and one span from the `system` service. Expand the `Inventory Manager Add` span and its **Span Attributes** field. You can see the `hostname` attribute with the `localhost` value that is created by the [hotspot=spanAttribute file=1]`@SpanAttribute` annotation.

image::inventory_manager_add_span.png[Inventory Manager add span,align="center"]


=== Creating custom spans

The MicroProfile Telemetry specification makes the underlying OpenTelemetry Tracer instance available. You can create spans manually by injecting the OpenTelemetry Tracer into your application.

#Replace the `InventoryResource` class:#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`

InventoryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[]
----

Inject the OpenTelemetry [hotspot=tracer file=0]`Tracer` interface into the [hotspot file=0]`InventoryResource` class to manually instrument your code to collect traces. Before the [hotspot=manager hotspot=getSystem file=0]`InventoryManager` calls the `system` service, it creates and starts a span named [hotspot=getPropertiesSpan file=0]`GettingProperties`.

Each span must be completed by calling [hotspot=end file=0]`end()`. To ensure the span is always ended, the call is placed inside a [hotspot=finally file=0]`finally` block.

The [hotspot=scope file=0]`makeCurrent()` method sets the span as the current span. This call returns a `Scope`, which should be closed to restore the previous span. A [hotspot=try file=0]`try-with-resources` block is used to close the scope automatically.

Use the [hotspot=addEvent1 hotspot=addEvent2 file=0]`addEvent()` method to add events to the span. In this example, the code adds one event when the properties are received and another when the request fails.

For more information about OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, see the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-api/latest/io/opentelemetry/api/trace/package-summary.html[OpenTelemetry distributed tracing API documentation^]. You can also refer to the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-telemetry-jaeger.html[Enabling distributed tracing in microservices with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger^] guide for details of tracing instrumentation in Open Liberty.

To see these spans and events, visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL and open the Grafana dashboard at the http://localhost:3000 URL. In the **Explore** view, select the **Tempo** data source and filter by the `inventory` service. You will see a trace that includes the `GettingProperties` span with the Received properties event.

image::inventory_service_spans.png[Get traces for the inventory service,align="center"]

To test a failure case, go to the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/unknown URL and run the same trace query in Grafana. There are two spans from the `inventory` service. You'll see the `GettingProperties` span. Expan the `GettingProperties` span and its **Events** field. You can see the `Cannot get properties` event.

== Testing the application 

Manually verify the telemetry signals by inspecting them in the Grafana dashboard. You can also run the included tests to check the basic functionality of the services. If any of the tests fail, you might have introduced a bug into the code.

=== Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in dev mode, run the tests for the `system` and `inventory` services by pressing the `enter/return` key in the command-line sessions where you started the services.

When you are done checking out the services, exit dev mode by pressing `CTRL+C` in the shell sessions where you ran the `system` and `inventory` services.

Finally, stop the Grafana OTel LGTM stack that you started in the **Additional prerequisites** section.
